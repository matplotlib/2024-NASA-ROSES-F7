abstract = {The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has a goal of detecting small planets orbiting stars bright enough for mass determination via ground-based radial velocity observations. Here, we present estimates of how many exoplanets the TESS mission will detect, the physical properties of the detected planets, and the properties of the stars that those planets orbit. This work uses stars drawn from the TESS Input Catalog Candidate Target List and revises yields from prior studies that were based on Galactic models. We modeled the TESS observing strategy to select approximately 200,000 stars at 2-minute cadence, while the remaining stars are observed at 30-minute cadence in full-frame image data. We placed zero or more planets in orbit around each star, with physical properties following measured exoplanet occurrence rates, and used the TESS noise model to predict the derived properties of the detected exoplanets. In the TESS 2-minute cadence mode we estimate that TESS will find 1250 ± 70 exoplanets (90\% confidence), including 250 smaller than 2 R⊕. Furthermore, we predict that an additional 3100 planets will be found in full-frame image data orbiting bright dwarf stars and more than 10,000 around fainter stars. We predict that TESS will find 500 planets orbiting M dwarfs, but the majority of planets will orbit stars larger than the Sun. Our simulated sample of planets contains hundreds of small planets amenable to radial velocity follow-up, potentially more than tripling the number of planets smaller than 4 R⊕ with mass measurements. This sample of simulated planets is available for use in planning follow-up observations and analyses.}

abstract = {Natural pits on the Moon expose deep cross-sections of the lunar maria, enabling direct investigation of the Moon's volcanic history and providing potential access to subsurface lava tubes. The Moon Diver mission concept seeks to explore the Mare Tranquillitatis pit, which exposes the largest wall of bedrock of the mare pits (∼65 m). The concept is enabled by two innovative capabilities: pinpoint landing near the pit and robotic access to its near-vertical wall with an instrument package to examine the elemental chemistry, mineralogy, and morphology of these bedrock layers. Pinpoint landing uses closed-loop guidance with terrain-relative navigation (TRN), which was advanced by Perseverance landing on Mars, to deliver the lander within a 100-m ellipse. The Axel robotic explorer, which remains tethered to the lander, would egress onto the lunar surface and traverse the relatively flat terrain to the pit's funnel entrance. The lander, which is the data link to Earth, also serves as an anchor and provides power and communication to the rover through its tether. The rover is a novel two-wheeled platform with a trailing boom and a spool that pays out the tether as the rover traverses toward the pit. The 300-m long tether is well margined for the rover to scale the pit wall. The rover carries a surface preparation tool and three additional instrument types: (a) three high-resolution cameras for acquiring context images of the near and far walls with the near-wall pair in a stereoscopic configuration, (b) an alpha-particle-X-ray spectrometer (APXS) for elemental composition, and (c) a multi-spectral microscopic imager (MMI) that uses controlled lighting for mineralogy. The surface-preparation tool removes dust and patina from the rock wall by grinding a small area. This tool, the MMI, and the APXS would be deployed from an instrument bay inside the wheel wells. The rover would independently point each instrument at the same target on the wall with millimeter repeatability. Landing shortly after sunrise, the surface mission timeline is just shy of a lunar daytime (14 Earth days). Beyond the primary mission, the rover would be capable of descending from the overhang and peering into the void that may open to a large cave or lava tube. Lunar pits provide an exciting new target for exploration using innovative robotic capabilities that have been tested with integrated science instruments at multiple terrestrial analogue sites including a pit with basaltic layers in Arizona.}

journal = {Research in Astronomy and Astrophysics},
abstract = {Radiative transfer models (RTMs) have been used to estimate grain size of amorphous and crystalline water (H2O) ice in the outer solar system from near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths. We use radiative scattering models to assess the discrepancy in grain size estimation of H2O ice at a temperature of 15, 40, 60, and 80 K (amorphous) and 20, 40, 60, and 80 K (crystalline)—relevant to the outer solar system. We compare the single scattering albedos of H2O ice phases using the Mie theory and Hapke approximation models from the optical constant at NIR wavelengths (1–5 μm). This study reveals that Hapke approximation models—Hapke slab and internal scattering model (ISM)—predict grain size of crystalline phase slightly closer to Mie model than amorphous phase at temperatures of 15–80 K. However, the Hapke slab model predicts, in general, grain sizes much closer to those of the Mie model's estimations while ISM predicted grain sizes exhibit a higher uncertainty. We recommend using the Mie model for unknown spectra of outer solar system bodies to estimate H2O ice grain sizes. While choosing the approximation model for employing RTMs, we recommend using a Hapke slab approximation model over the ISM.}

abstract = {Abstract Stellar occultation measurements conducted by the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile and EvolutioN/Imaging UltraViolet Spectrograph instrument were able to make vertically resolved measurements of ozone density in the middle atmosphere of Mars that offered good coverage with respect to latitude, longitude, and local time. These measurements were used to identify systematic variations in the vertical structure of ozone with longitude that could be distinguished from general trends in the evolution of ozone with respect to season and latitude. A total of 583 individual nightside occultations between Martian years 32 and 36 were analyzed, of which 224 were confirmed to have ozone, all found between Ls = 15°–165°. Close to aphelion (Ls = 60°–90°), peak ozone densities between 30 and 40 km altitude were observed to be within error of model predictions at all measured latitudes, but diverged from model predictions before and after this time. At low latitudes, seasonal changes were seen to have the greatest effect on the observed vertical structure of ozone, with detached ozone layer densities at altitudes above 30 km usually varying within approximately a factor of two along a given latitudinal band at a given time of year. Nonetheless, evidence of a persistent regional enhancement of ozone abundance was observed over equatorial latitudes during the aphelion season, spanning a longitude range of approximately 50°–130°E longitude. Planetary waves were clearly observed at higher Southern latitudes during Southern winter, often resulting in order of magnitude variations in ozone density with longitude.},
