  abstract =     {Array programming provides a powerful, compact and
                  expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and
                  operating on data in vectors, matrices and
                  higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary
                  array programming library for the Python
                  language. It has an essential role in research
                  analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics,
                  chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology,
                  psychology, materials science, engineering, finance
                  and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was
                  an important part of the software stack used in the
                  discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first
                  imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few
                  fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and
                  powerful programming paradigm for organizing,
                  exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is
                  the foundation upon which the scientific Python
                  ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that
                  several projects, targeting audiences with
                  specialized needs, have developed their own
                  NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to
                  its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy
                  increasingly acts as an interoperability layer
                  between such array computation libraries and,
                  together with its application programming interface
                  (API), provides a flexible framework to support the
                  next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

In particular, the state of the art in space and Earth science often arises from complex simulations of climate, space weather, and astronomical phenomena. At the same time, scientific work requires data processing, presentation, and analysis through broadly available proprietary and community software.1 Implicitly or explicitly, software is central to science. Scientific discovery, understanding, validation, and interpretation are all enhanced by access to the source code of the software used by scientists.\n\nThis report investigates and recommends options for NASA\u2019s Science Mission Directorate (SMD) as it considers how to establish a policy regarding open source software to complement its existing policy on open data. In particular, the report reviews existing data and software policies and the lessons learned from the implementation of those policies, summarizes community perspectives, and presents policy options and recommendations for implementing an open source software policy for NASA SMD.",

  abstract =     {Abstract Two sprite-producing thunderstorms were
                  observed on 8 and 25 June 2012 in northeastern
                  Colorado by a combination of low-light cameras, a
                  lightning mapping array, polarimetric and Doppler
                  radars, the National Lightning Detection Network,
                  and charge moment change measurements. The 8 June
                  event evolved from a tornadic hailstorm to a larger
                  multicellular system that produced 21 observed
                  positive sprites in 2 h. The majority of sprites
                  occurred during a lull in convective strength, as
                  measured by total flash rate, flash energy, and
                  radar echo volume. Mean flash area spiked multiple
                  times during this period; however, total flash rates
                  still exceeded 60 min−1, and portions of the storm
                  featured a complex anomalous charge structure, with
                  midlevel positive charge near −20°C. The storm
                  produced predominantly positive cloud-to-ground
                  lightning. All sprite-parent flashes occurred on the
                  northeastern flank of the storm, where strong
                  westerly upper level flow was consistent with
                  advection of charged precipitation away from
                  convection, providing a pathway for stratiform
                  lightning. The 25 June event was another
                  multicellular hailstorm with an anomalous charge
                  structure that produced 26 positive sprites in less
                  than 1 h. The sprites again occurred during a
                  convective lull, with relatively weaker reflectivity
                  and lower total flash rate but relatively larger
                  mean flash area. However, all sprite parents
                  occurred in or near convection and tapped charge
                  layers in adjacent anvil cloud. The results
                  demonstrate the sprite production by convective
                  ground strokes in anomalously charged storms and
                  also indicate that sprite production and convective
                  vigor are inversely related in mature storms.},

                  exists between these data sets during the year
                  2015. Both observe the dramatic reversal from
                  wintertime trade winds (November–April) to westerly
                  flow associated with the summer monsoon
                  (May–October). These seasonal changes have strong
                  but not equivalent effects on mean wind divergence
                  patterns in both data sets. Specifically near the
                  Philippines, the data sets agree on several aspects
                  of the seasonal mean and diurnal cycle of
                  near-surface vector winds and divergence. In
                  particular, RapidScat and CCMP agree that daytime
                  onshore and nocturnal offshore flow patterns affect
                  the diurnal cycle of winds up to ~200 km west of
                  Luzon, Philippines. Observed disagreements over the
                  diurnal cycle are explainable by measurement

  abstract =     {During the solar minimum, when the Sun is at its
                  least active, the solar wind1,2 is observed at high
                  latitudes as a predominantly fast (more than 500
                  kilometres per second), highly Alfv{\'e}nic rarefied
                  stream of plasma originating from deep within
                  coronal holes. Closer to the ecliptic plane, the
                  solar wind is interspersed with a more variable slow
                  wind3 of less than 500 kilometres per second. The
                  precise origins of the slow wind streams are less
                  certain4; theories and observations suggest that
                  they may originate at the tips of helmet
                  streamers5,6, from interchange reconnection near
                  coronal hole boundaries7,8, or within coronal holes
                  with highly diverging magnetic fields9,10. The
                  heating mechanism required to drive the solar wind
                  is also unresolved, although candidate mechanisms
                  include Alfv{\'e}n-wave turbulence11,12, heating by
                  reconnection in nanoflares13, ion cyclotron wave
                  heating14 and acceleration by thermal gradients1. At
                  a distance of one astronomical unit, the wind is
                  mixed and evolved, and therefore much of the
                  diagnostic structure of these sources and processes
                  has been lost. Here we present observations from the
                  Parker Solar Probe15 at 36 to 54 solar radii that
                  show evidence of slow Alfv{\'e}nic solar wind
                  emerging from a small equatorial coronal hole. The
                  measured magnetic field exhibits patches of large,
                  intermittent reversals that are associated with jets
                  of plasma and enhanced Poynting flux and that are
                  interspersed in a smoother and less turbulent flow
                  with a near-radial magnetic field. Furthermore,
                  plasma-wave measurements suggest the existence of
                  electron and ion velocity-space
                  micro-instabilities10,16 that are associated with
                  plasma heating and thermalization processes. Our
                  measurements suggest that there is an impulsive
                  mechanism associated with solar-wind energization
                  and that micro-instabilities play a part in heating,
                  and we provide evidence that low-latitude coronal
                  holes are a key source of the slow solar wind.},

                  Satellite-R series of weather satellites provides
                  point geolocations of lightning flashes that are
                  further comprised of a hierarchy of geolocated
                  groups and events. This study describes an
                  open-source method for reconstruction of imagery
                  from those point detections that retains the
                  quantitative physical measurements made by GLM,
                  restores the spatial footprint of the events, and
                  connects that spatial footprint to the groups and
                  flashes. Meteorological signals are demonstrated to
                  be more apparent in the gridded imagery than in the
                  point detections, leading to their adoption by the
                  United States National Weather Service as the first
                  GLM product available in their real-time
                  displays. Analysis of a mesoscale convective system
                  over Argentina confirms that there is a class of
                  propagating lightning observed by GLM (distinct from
                  that in storm cores) that can be visualized and
                  quantified using our imagery-based approach.},

                  Terra, Mars, dozens of moderately sized impact
                  craters (10 to 100 km diameter) contain layered
                  sedimentary deposits. Previous work has found that
                  these layers are resolvable at the meter scale and
                  that they are quasiperiodic in expression. However,
                  the interrelationships of these deposits, along with
                  their formative depositional process, has not yet
                  been determined. Proposed formation mechanisms
                  include fluviolacustrine deposition, groundwater
                  upwelling and evaporation, and aeolian or distal
                  volcanic air fall. For this study, we measured layer
                  thicknesses from stereo image-derived topography
                  within nine craters. We find two regionally
                  extensive layered units with characteristic average
                  bed thicknesses of 12 and 3.5 m and a possible third
                  unit of intermediate thickness. Each unit was
                  identified in a number of craters forming regionally
                  consistent groups. These proposed units represent
                  the first regional correlations of isolated
                  sedimentary deposits in Arabia Terra and point to
                  blanketing regional deposition over at least two
                  separate geologic periods.},

                  (Mastcam) system is a pair of fixed-focal length,
                  multispectral, color CCD imagers mounted ~2 m above
                  the surface on the rover's remote sensing mast,
                  along with associated electronics and an onboard
                  calibration target. The left Mastcam (M-34) has a
                  34 mm focal length, an instantaneous field of view
                  (IFOV) of 0.22 mrad, and a FOV of 20° × 15° over the
                  full 1648 × 1200 pixel span of its Kodak KAI-2020
                  CCD. The right Mastcam (M-100) has a 100 mm focal
                  length, an IFOV of 0.074 mrad, and a FOV of
                  6.8° × 5.1° using the same detector. The cameras are
                  separated by 24.2 cm on the mast, allowing stereo
                  images to be obtained at the resolution of the M-34
                  camera. Each camera has an eight-position filter
                  wheel, enabling it to take Bayer pattern red, green,
                  and blue (RGB) “true color” images, multispectral
                  images in nine additional bands spanning
                  ~400–1100 nm, and images of the Sun in two colors
                  through neutral density-coated filters. An
                  associated Digital Electronics Assembly provides
                  command and data interfaces to the rover, 8 Gb of
                  image storage per camera, 11 bit to 8 bit
                  companding, JPEG compression, and acquisition of
                  high-definition video. Here we describe the
                  preflight and in-flight calibration of Mastcam
                  images, the ways that they are being archived in the
                  NASA Planetary Data System, and the ways that
                  calibration refinements are being developed as the
                  investigation progresses on Mars. We also provide
                  some examples of data sets and analyses that help to

                  calibration.},

                  one rotational period was observed for 51 of these
                  targets, allowing for well constrained lightcurve
                  rotation periods and amplitudes, five of which are
                  found to be in conflict with previously published
                  values. We find ∼10% of objects have rotational
                  periods longer than 100 hr, an excess of slow
                  rotators 10 times larger than suggested from the
                  literature. Investigation of the rotational
                  frequencies of our Kepler sample when combined with
                  high-quality lightcurves in the literature reveals
                  the distribution of rotational frequencies is
                  non-Maxwellian even when consideration is given to
                  size-dependent variations in rotational rate. From
                  investigation of lightcurve shapes and amplitudes,
                  we estimate the binary fraction within the Trojan
                  population to be ∼6%–36% depending on the
                  methodology utilized to identify binary candidates.}

                  a heliocentric distance of 44 au, “MU69” will be the
                  most distant object ever visited by a spacecraft. To

                  processing pipeline, making maximal use of the
                  Hubble Space Telescope’s Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3)
                  and pre-release versions of the ESA Gaia Data

                  successful predictions of a stellar occultation by
                  MU69 in 2017 July. We describe how we process the
                  WFC3 images to match the Gaia DR2 catalog, extract
                  positional uncertainties for this extremely faint
                  target (typically 140 photons per WFC3 exposure),
                  and translate those uncertainties into probability
                  distribution functions for MU69 at any given
                  time. We also describe how we use these
                  uncertainties to guide New Horizons, plan stellar
                  occultions of MU69, and derive MU69's orbital
                  evolution and long-term stability.}
