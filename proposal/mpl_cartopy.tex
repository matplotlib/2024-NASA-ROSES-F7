\subsection{Matplotlib and cartopy's role in scientific computing}
\subsubsection{Matplotlib}
% - TODO trim this whole section down to make space for cartopy

% - TODO find a Earth science and/or helio flagship using Matplotlib

Matplotlib~\cite{Hunter:2007} is a comprehensive Python library for
creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.  It
provides the visualization for projects across all SMD divisions,
including flagship missions like the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and
the James Webb Space Telescope~\cite{jwst_pipeline} (JWST), and
instruments like the Curiosity Rover
Mastcam~\cite{https://doi.org/10.1002/2016EA000219}.


Matplotlib is part of the Scientific Python Ecosystem (SPE), a loosely defined
community of projects and programmers with the common goal of advancing science
through the use of the Python programming language.  This development
historically has been largely volunteer work or work that is sponsored
implicitly by specific science projects, but recently there has been explicit
funding.  SPE, shown with a rough schematic in Figure \ref{fig:ecosystem}, has
a core of general purpose domain-agnostic tools, like NumPy~\cite{Harris2020}
and SciPy~\cite{Virtanen2020}. Matplotlib is in the next ring of specialized,
but still domain agnostic tools, and is the most prevalent data visualization
library for the SPE.  The outer rings are increasingly domain-specific tools,
like AstroPy~\cite{astropy:2013, astropy:2018} for astrophysics,
SunPy~\cite{sunpy_community2020} for heliophysics, and MetPy~\cite{metpy} and
cartopy~\cite{Cartopy} for earth sciences; all of these use Matplotlib for
specialized plotting.  This layered approach gives scientists and engineers
convenient and powerful high-level tools while enabling direct access to the
underlying libraries when needed.


\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}
  \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{scipy-ecosystem}
  \caption{\small A schematic of the Scientific Python ecosytem.  At the
    core we have the Python language itself with concentric rings of

    left) and SunPy (top right), used in the astrophysics and
    heliophysics divisions respectively, rely on Matplotlib (center, circled)

    in Science'', PyCon 2017}
  \label{fig:ecosystem}
\end{wrapfigure}


Soon after its start by John D. Hunter in 2002, Matplotlib began growing as an
open source plotting library with a BSD-compatible license. The first commits
in the Matplotlib history date to early 2003.  Over the last 21 years
Matplotlib has been actively developed and maintained by a vibrant, primarily
volunteer, community.  Matplotlib has over 1,700 individual contributors to the
code base, with many more individuals having contributed in ways not easily
tracked, such as answering user questions on the mailing list and reporting
issues.

% - TODO mention the new work here?

Matplotlib has a high-level API for quick plotting, such as in
exploratory data analysis, plus a low-level API that gives full control for
fine-tuned publication-quality plots, for animations, for writing both
GUI-independent and GUI-specific tools for interactive data plotting, and
for output to a variety of vector and raster
formats including \texttt{svg}, \texttt{eps},
\texttt{pdf}, and \texttt{png}.

Matplotlib's generality and flexibility make it readily extendable to
many data visualization domains.  A rich ecosystem of downstream packages use
Matplotlib as their base, providing domain-specific streamlining of
Matplotlib's API: including
yt~\cite{2011ApJS..192....9T}, AstroPy~\cite{astropy:2013,
  astropy:2018}, ArviZ~\cite{arviz_2019},
seaborn~\cite{waskom2020seaborn}, xarray~\cite{hoyer2017xarray},
cartopy~\cite{Cartopy}, corner.py~\cite{corner} and
mpl-scatter-density~\cite{mpl-scatter-density}.

Matplotlib is ubiquitous in scientific computing.  Conservative estimates based
on downloads and on usage of the documentation website indicate that Matplotlib
has over a million users.  We expect that a large fraction of NASA
SMD-sponsored projects rely on this shared infrastructure to some degree, but
this is hard to quantify.  It is not usual, but becoming more common, to cite
tool chains in scientific literature, so citation counts are likely to
under-represent the scientific use of Matplotlib.  Nevertheless, the canonical
reference for Matplotlib~\cite{Hunter:2007} has over 31,800 citations overall.
and has over 12,800 citations in ADS~\cite{ads_mpl}.



% - TODO re-run this code to get up-to-date numbers
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.5\textwidth}
  \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{arXiv_usage}
  \caption{\small Percent of all papers on arXiv per-month that have a
    Matplotlib metadata in the files associated with the paper.  When saving a
    figure Matplotlib sets the string ``Matplotlib'' and the version of the
    library to the producer field or equivalent of the file.}
  \label{fig:arxiv}
\end{wrapfigure}

Figure~\ref{fig:arxiv} shows an empirical measure of usage by looking from at
metadata in files uploaded to the arXiv.  When saving figures Matplotlib
inserts a string into the file metadata indicating that it was created by
Matplotlib (and by what version).  By searching the files uploaded to the arXiv
for the string ``matplotlib'' we can thus put a rough lower bound, as
post-processing may lose the metadata, on the number of papers that mention or
have at least one figure generated by Matplotlib.  As of early 2023 over 17\%
of all new papers uploaded have used Matplotlib and as of 2018Q2 over a third
of papers published to astro-ph on the Arxiv contained a figure generated with
Matplotlib~\cite{arxvi_stats}.  All measures of Matplotlib's usage show clear upward
trends.

\subsubsection{Carotpy}

% - TODO write up cartopy description

\subsection{Objectives}

% - keep the lights on
% - cartopy refactor
% - partner with NASA mission(s)

Matplotlib is a primarily community-driven project, but we have grown to the
point where we need supported developers with the time to organize, plan, and
make decisions.  Supported developers will continue to allow us to take on more
complex projects than can be implemented by part-time volunteer effort alone,
while executing critical day-to-day maintenance tasks required to keep the
project healthy.  \textbf{We propose to split the effort on this grant IN SOME
  WAY between maintenance and new development}.


\subsubsection{Refactor cartopy}

\subsubsection{General maintenance}

We need to sustain Matplotlib as a vibrant project and continue to support the
hundred of thousands of users and hundreds of downstream packages.  To maintain
Matplotlib's health we must:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item fix critical bugs and regressions promptly as they are reported;
\item make improvements while maintaining backward compatibility and
  documenting changes;
\item categorize Issues and PRs in terms of topic, difficulty, and
  urgency;
\item entrain new contributors to sustain and diversify the community
  developer team;
\item maintain the continuous-integration infrastructure;
\item manage the release process;
\item and manage community discussions about proposed enhancements, features,
  and API changes.
\end{itemize}
These are tasks that are never ``done''; users find new ways to use
the library, they expose previously un-detected bugs, they request or propose new
features, and the world continues to changes around us.   \textbf{Dedicated
full-time developers help ensure that things happen in a consistent and timely
manner, and provide the crucial roadmaps that will steer the future of the library}.


%plot?

Historically, pull requests (PRs) and issues have been submitted
faster than they can be reviewed; Matplotlib has accumulated about 300
open PRs and 1300 open issues due to this imbalance. There are
critical bug reports and insightful feature requests among the issue
backlog, while among the PR backlog there are useful contributions or
bug fixes that would improve the libraries for direct users and
downstream packages.  The large backlog is discouraging for new and
occasional contributors and distracting for core developers.

% - TODO update to include rest of CZI grants + current ROSES grant

In 2020, with a grant from CZI supporting a Research Software Engineer
(RSE) working on Matplotlib for 10 month, we resolved 2,056 PRs and
999 issues.  However, even at this rate we only reduced the PR backlog
by 70 open PRs and held the issue backlog even.  As part of reducing
the backlog, we were able to fix several long-standing bugs.  We have
demonstrated that supporting maintenance work has a positive effect on
the health of the project and \textbf{the additional resources
  requested here will further reduce, but not eliminate, the
  maintenance backlog}.


\subsection{Impact and Relevance to Science Mission Directorate}


% - TODO re-check these numbers

As mentioned above, it is hard to estimate the prevalence of open
source software due to it being freely distributed and not
systematically cited.  Matplotlib is in the top 100 most-downloaded
packages from PyPI~\cite{pypi_stats} and is packaged by every major
Linux and scientific Python distribution.  Another metric to measure
impact is static analysis of publicly available code.  According to
github over 299k repositories and over 12k packages hosted on GitHub
depend on Matplotlib~\cite{gh_deps:2021}. A recent study of the
almost 10M Jupyter notebooks on github found that over 3M of them have
a direct Matplotlib import~\cite{datalore:2020}.

% - update with more recent examples, sort by division

Exoplanets \cite{2020AJ....160..116G}

These measures show broad impact but cover many uses outside of the
SMD community.  If we restrict the static analysis to
\url{https://github.com/nasa}, NASA's official organization on GitHub,
we see that 53 of the 330 hosted repositories make reference to
Matplotlib.  Soliciting on social media for examples of Matplotlib in SMD research
yielded a (non-exhaustive) list including:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item
  to study
  thunderstorms~\cite{https://doi.org/10.1002/2016JD025299,https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JD030874},
  seasonal ocean winds~\cite{https://doi.org/10.1002/2017JD027516} and
  tropical storms~\cite{Lang_2020};
\item in the first science paper from the Parker Solar
  probe~\cite{Bale2019};
\item in the Martian science program in both
  orbiter~\cite{https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JE006188} and
  rover~\cite{https://doi.org/10.1002/2016EA000219} contexts;
\item as part of ground operations from the Mars Phoenix Lander;
\item with data from Kepler and K2 missions to study Trojan
  asteroids~\cite{Nixon_2019} and
  Titan~\cite{Ryan_2017,2019PASP..131h4505P};
\item on the New Horizons Kuiper belt extended
  mission~\cite{Porter_2018};
\item for visualization of scheduling, safety and constraint checks,
  and telemetry by the Swift science operations
  team~\cite{swift_ops,2020ApJ...900...35T};
\item as part of the HST and JWST~\cite{jwst_pipeline} data processing
  pipelines;
\item in Monte, JPL's mission design
  and navigation software system to support spaceflight operations;
\item in fundamental research on graphene~\cite{PhysRevLett.120.236802};
\item and for work on nuclear powered rockets~\cite{leu_cerment}.
\end{itemize}
This list shows the breadth of Matplotlib usage across the SMD
divisions.  Matplotlib falls under the umbrella of projects which the
National Academies of Science recommended for funding in the report
``Open Source Software Policy Options for NASA Earth and Space
Sciences (2018)''~\cite{NAP25217} (Option B4).
\textbf{Small investments in Matplotlib will have returns across the
  entire SMD portfolio}.

Maintaining Matplotlib's health and engineering for its future will
have wide-ranging impacts for the scientific community, and for NASA in
particular.  As pointed out above, Matplotlib is the plotting layer
for much of the Python ecosystem.  It has been used in thousands of
academic papers, plotting for news and sporting media, technical
dash-boarding, and most modern data science applications.
% - TODO re-run this with updated numbers, re-run
Matplotlib has also been used in a number
of high-profile astronomy projects including the Nobel prize-winning
observation of black hole merger by the Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), the 2020 Nobel prize-winning
discovery of a super massive compact object at the center of our
galaxy and the recent observation of Sagittarius A* by the Event
Horizon Telescope (EHT).

This proposal is another step towards Matplotlib's sustainability, and
ability to move forward. Given the usage and the scale of the library
it is not sustainable to continue to maintain Matplotlib as a
volunteer-only effort.  A core team of full-time developers and
managers will better co-ordinate and nurture volunteer efforts, with
the goal of growing and sustaining a diverse community of volunteer
expert contributors.

Finally, with explicit support for their time, Matplotlib's core developers
will better be able to plan the project's future.
This requires vision, co-ordination with the rest of the scientific
Python community, including downstream libraries, and getting out in
the community to get feedback.  It is very hard to provide that
leadership and vision while working a ``day job''.

\subsection{Technical Approach and Methodology}

\subsection{Risk Management}

There is minimal risk in the maintenance work.  There is a large volume
of individually small tasks that need to be addressed: the issue and
PR backlogs.  Any dedicated effort devoted to clearing the backlog
will have a positive impact on the project.  We have demonstrated that
supporting developers for maintenance work is an effective and
efficient use of resources.

% - need to be very careful about not breaking back-compatibility
There is also the risk than we are underestimating the amount of work
that will be required.  There is always a possibility that during
refactoring the scope of work will rapidly snowball due to unexpected
internal dependencies or edge cases.
However, even in the event that we cannot complete the implementation of a new data
pipeline model within the performance period, throughout the process we will be working towards
improving library internals and improving our
documentation.

We anticipate that all of the work can be done incrementally and will
be merged to the default branch of Matplotlib throughout the
performance period.  Frequently merging incremental work reduces the
risk, and is consistent with our standard development process.  Work
done under this proposal will be reviewed in our normal fashion, and many
small PRs are easier to review and merge than a single large PR.
Large PRs also quickly drift out of sync with the master branch, and
develop insurmountable rebase requirements.  The improvements, both to
the code and documentation, will be released to users as part of our
standard semiannual release cadence.

There is personnel risk in that we have not yet identified the RSEs who will be
a key individual for carrying out this work.  We are optimistic that we will be
able to recruit a qualified individuals in reasonable time.  We have now hired
two individuals as fulltime RSEs through NumFOCUS within reasonable time
frames.

\subsection{Contributions of Principal Investigator and Key Personnel}

Dr.\ Thomas A.\ Caswell has the sole individual responsibility for directing
and supervising the execution of this work.  He has extensive experience
developing and maintaining Python libraries for scientists.  He has been
involved with Matplotlib from 2012 and had a leadership role in the project
from 2014.  He is also a core developer of h5py and has contributed to many of
the other core projects of the SPE.  He is currently a group leader of the Data
Acquisition and Detectors group in the Data Science and Systems Integration
program at the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) at Brookhaven
National Labratory and the technical lead of a new beamline at NSLS-II.  He is
also the lead architect and developer of the Bluesky Suite, an ecosystem of
co-developed libraries and applications for data acquisition and management,
which is being adopted for beamline operations at synchrotrons in the US and
across the world.

\subsection{Work Plan}


\subsubsection{General Maintenance}

Throughout the project both Dr.\ Caswell and the RSE will work on
Matplotlib general maintenance and community engagement.  This includes,
but is not limited to, fixing bugs, reviewing Pull Requests, answering
user questions, welcoming new contributors to the project, and
planning for the future.  Dr.\ Caswell will particularly focus on
the project roadmap and community governance.

% 4 part plan
%  1. document how units work now, document how it should work, id problems
%  2. work to adapt the theoretical and prototype datasource work to API stable
%  3. plan!
%  4. re-write every Artist sub-class

\subsubsection{Data Model Refactor}

\subsubsection{Work Process}

All work under this proposal will undergo the same review process
as any other contribution.  We
encourage many small PRs to reduce risk.  At least one maintainer not
supported on this proposal
will need to sign off on any changes before they are merged. This
disseminates understanding of the proposed work and ensures
community buy-in.  Finally, by merging
changes to the default branch continuously throughout the period of
work the incremental improvements will be released as part of our
semiannual release cadence.

The RSE will present the status of the work at two conferences yearly,
expected to be SciPy in July and one of PyData regional conferences in
the winter.


\subsubsection{Grant Management}

Dr.\ Caswell of BNL and the Matplotlib Project Lead is the PI of the proposed
development.  He is responsible for the quality and direction of the proposed
work and the proper use of all awarded funds.  He is also responsible for all
management, and budget issues and is the final authority for this task.


\subsection{Matplotlib Project Management}
\subsubsection{Governance and Finances}

Matplotlib is a NumFOCUS Fiscally Sponsored Project.

Matplotlib is governed by a steering council, a Project Lead (PL), and
several Deputy Project Leads (DPL)~\cite{gov}.  We are a community
project and try to make all decisions, both strategic and day-to-day,
by consensus.  However, if consensus can not be reached, the
responsibility falls back to the DPLs and ultimately to the PL.  The
current PL is Dr.\ Caswell.

As Matplotlib has matured we have moved from a single person,
originally Dr.\ John Hunter, to a ``BDFL'' governance model.  The
leadership of the project passed to Dr.\ Micheal Droettboom in 2012.
In 2014 Dr.\ Caswell and Dr.\ Droettboom were co-leads and in 2016
Dr.\ Caswell took over as the sole project lead.  In 2020 we formally
adopted the current governance model.

\subsubsection{License}

Matplotlib is licensed under the Matplotlib License~\cite{mpl_lic}
which is a derivative of the Python Software Foundation
license~\cite{psf_lic} and is a permissive license compatible with the
BSD license~\cite{jdh_bsd_opinions}.

Cartopy is licenced under the BSD-3 clause.


\subsubsection{Sustainability Metrics}

There are many possible ways to measure the sustainability of an
open source project.  We propose to focus on growing our developer
community, reducing our Issue and PR backlogs, and maintaining a
regular release cadence.

Matplotlib is a community driven project with a vast majority of the
work done by volunteers.  The thing we are shortest on is the time of
maintainers who are able and willing to review Pull Requests.
Increasing the number of regular contributors and maintainers improves
the sustainability of the project in several ways; many hands make
light work and it makes the project resilient to individuals leaving
the project.

Quantitatively evaluating maintenance work can be tricky --- some
Issues or PRs take minutes to review while others can take days to
weeks of effort --- but we believe that there is value at looking at
the total number of open Issues and PRs and the rate at which they are
addressed.  We aim to close Issues and PRs faster than they are opened
until a reasonable equilibrium is reached.  We will aim to hit the
following metrics:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Initial response to all issues / new PRs within a week
\item Resolve majority of new issues / PRs within 1 month
\item Reduce backlog of issues by 25 / quarter
\item Reduce backlog of PRs by 25 / quarter
\end{itemize}

Finally, for the user community to benefit from our work we need to do
regular releases.  We will continue to maintain a bi-yearly release
cycle for feature releases with 1-3 bug-fix releases as needed.
Holding to a time-based release schedule is advantageous because it
provides predictability to our users and reduce the lag between when a
new feature is merged to the default branch and when it is generally
available.


\subsubsection{Collaboration with Related Projects}


Much of the communication is through the standard communication
channels, such as project issue trackers, mailing lists or discussions
forums, and submitting PRs.  The strongest relationships, both
historical and current, are with projects where we have shared
developers.  For example Ryan May and Elliot sales de Andre are both
core contributors to Matplotlib and Cartopy and David Stansby is a
maintainer on both Matplotlib and \texttt{SunPy}.  Micheal Droettboom,
the previous Matplotlib Project lead, was a core developer on Astropy.
Additionally, through NumFOCUS and domain-specific conferences there
are regular in-person meetings.

We will work with down-stream projects to help them improve their test
coverage of plotting code and to add jobs to their continuous
integration that test development snap-shots of Matplotlib.  This is
particularly useful during the planned refactor as we will be making
extensive changes to Matplotlib that we believe are backwards
compatible, but down-stream projects and users exercise the library in
ways the test suite does not.  While we hope to introduce any
regressions, catching them before release is the next best thing.

% wording all NF projects are putting in, please avoid wordsmithing it.
As a NumFOCUS project, we recognize the importance of every project
that is part of our open source scientific computing community. Though
we would like for our work to be funded we are committed to supporting
and collaborating with other NumFOCUS projects that receive funding
regardless of our own outcome. We believe that this attitude is
crucial for the success of our community and the sustainability of
open source projects. It is our hope that this sentiment will be taken
into consideration when evaluating our proposal.


\subsubsection{Inclusive Community Development}

% - TODO this subsubsection may move to the inclusion plan which is
% required for foundation level call

Matplotlib strives to be an inclusive and open project, anyone who is
willing and able to contribute to the project should feel welcome to
do so.  We have adopted the Contributor Covenant V2.0 as
our Code of Conduct~\cite{CoC}.

Matplotlib has an open development model, all work is done in the open
and welcome contributions, in the from of bug reports, feature
requests, or pull requests from anyone.  We maintain an extensive
contribution guide
(\url{https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/devel/index.html}) as part of our
documentation.  To improve the development and retention of new
contributors we have recently started two efforts: an ``incubator''
channel on element and a Triage Team.

%% I really want to put this in, but do not see a good place for it :/
%
% It is important for everyone working on the project to feel safe to
% make mistakes.

The hardest part of getting started to contributing to open source
projects is can be simply getting started.  Open source communities,
particularly big ones, can be intimidating for first time
contributors.  The incubator is a semi-closed chat room where new
contributors can get support on any aspect of contributing to
Matplotlib.  This include the technical aspects of the code they are
working on, help with git/github, our review process, or the social
expectations and norms of the community.  The goal is that by
providing this support to first time contributors we will retain more
of them as regular contributors and then maintainers.

The issue tracker is important to communication in the project because
it serves as the centralized location for making feature requests,
reporting bugs, identifying major projects to work on, and discussing
priorities.  For this reason, it is important to curate the issue
list, adding labels to issues and closing issues that are resolved or
unresolvable. Triaging issues does not require any particular
expertise in the internals of Matplotlib but is extremely valuable to
the project.  To this end we have created a ``Triage Team'' in the
organization who have power to tag, milestone, and close issues.  In
addition to the direct benefit of improving the issue triage and
freeing the core-developers to spend more time reviewing PRs, this
role will bring more people into the developer community and may
provide a path way to becoming regular contributors and maintainers.

Ongoing work at NumFOCUS to develop metrics will help us evaluate the
efficacy of these efforts at diversifying our contributor base.

\subsubsection{Contribution Workflow}
%check that this is not a required title
%\subsection{Technical approach and methodology}

\paragraph{Matplotlib}
Matplotlib is an established community driven project in the
``federation'' model as defined by Nadia Eghbal~\cite{eghbal_2020}.
We have a core group regular maintainers who take responsibility for
reviewing and merging proposed changes to the library and  welcome Pull
Requests from anyone who is interesting in contributing.  We strive
for consensus and rely on the collective judgment of our maintainers
to maintain the quality and functionality of the library.

Matplotlib uses a variation on the ``git flow'' process~\cite{ghflow}
to manage proposing and reviewing contributions to the library and
documentation on GitHub.  Changes are proposed by opening a ``Pull
Request'' on GitHub; the process is the same for core maintainers,
regular contributors, and a first time contributors.  The proposed
changes are reviewed by maintainers who either request changes, which
starts a cycle of iteration with the contributor, or approve.  In
addition to human review we have an extensive test suite that is
automatically run via cloud services and the results are reported to
the PR.  Once consensus is reached and the test pass the PR is merged
and the changes will be released as part of the next release.

Matplotlib maintains an extensive suite of automated tests that
exercises a large fraction of our code base.  The full test suite, and
a build of the documentation, is run against several versions of
Python on OSX, Windows, and Linux hosts on every PR and merge to the
default branch via continuous integration.  For every new feature or
bug fix that gets merged we also add tests that codify the expected
behavior.  This gives us the ability to make changes to the library
with confidence that we will not break existing behavior.

The threshold for merging a PR depends on the reviewer judgment of the
risk of the changes.  PRs that only change documentation, which cannot
introduce regressions or introduce new features, may be merged by the
first reviewer whereas code changes need to be reviewed and approved
by at least two maintainers (not including the author of the PR).
However in either case a maintainer may wish to leave a positive
review but not merge the PR to request additional feed back from other
maintainers.  If a maintainer objects to a PR, the PR will not be
merged until their concerns have been addressed.  If consensus cannot
be reached, the final decision falls back to a Deputy Project Lead or
the Project Lead.

Matplotlib is cautious about making backwards-incompatible change that
intentionally break users existing code.  While in an ideal world,
future versions of the library would be 100\% backwards compatible
with previous versions, sometimes we do need to make incompatible
changes.  As part of the review process we check that any API changes
are well documented and justified.  When technically possible we
provide user-visible warnings the version before we actually implement
a breaking change.  This provides a window for users to either adapt
to the change or to communicate to us that they cannot adapt so we
can reconsider the change.  Given this high barrier to changing or
removing behavior we are careful to make sure that any new API we add
to the library is well thought out and complete because once we have
released a version of the library with that code it is hard to take it
back.  These considerations together are important enough that we have
a Deputy Project Lead responsible for API consistency.

This process works well for incremental contributions and bug fixes,
new features or bigger changes are typically discussed before
significant work is done.  In many cases if the feature does not need
to be in the core library we encourage contributors to create a new
stand-alone project.  This has several advantages including the giving
the author more control, allows them to iterate faster than our 6
month release schedule, and gives them greater flexibility to change
their APIs.

\subsubsection{Information Dissemination}

\paragraph{Matplotlib}

As a project Matplotlib maintains a range of communication channels
aimed at several, overlapping, audiences.  This includes a
the source, issue tracker and PRs on GitHub,
the published documentation (including historical and development versions),
weekly developer call,
mailing lists,
a discourse forum,
an active chat room on element,
in-person presentations at conferences and pydata events,
a blog, and several social media accounts.


The center of gravity of Matplotlib development takes place on GitHub
(\url{https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib}) where the canonical
repository for the source and documentation is hosted.  Around this
repository we use Issues and PRs to track bug reports, feature
requests, and to discuss proposed changes.  We also host our
governance documents on GitHub
(\url{https://github.com/matplotlib/governance}) and revise them via
Pull Request.

We publish extensive prose, example, and API documentation
(\url{https://matplotilb.org}) that is refreshed with each release.
In addition to the top-level docs, which always refer to the most
recent release, we also host historical
(e.g. \url{https://matplotlib.org/3.1.3} for the v3.1.3 documentation) and
development versions of the documentation
(\url{https://dev.matplotlib.org}).  In 2020 we had between 700k-1M
unique visitors a month to the documentation.


The weekly developer calls are typically attended by six to eight
people and are used for high-bandwidth discussions about both the
overall direction of the project and technical issues.  The agenda and
minutes are publicly available
(\url{https://hackmd.io/team/matplotlib}) and the calls are open to
all.

Matplotlib has an active element
(\url{https://gitter.im/matplotlib/matplotlib}) chat room.  Element is
a real-time chat platform that we use for general coordination and
resolving minor technical discussions.  While the chat room's history
is technically persistent, we treat it as transient.  For more
in-depth discussions or anything we want a record of, we move the
conversation to github, the mailing list, or discourse.

For user support and general discussion we maintain two mailing lists,
matplotlib-users
(\url{https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/matplotlib-users}) for
user support and matplotlib-devel
(\url{https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/matplotlib-devel}) for
developer discussion and announcements, and a discourse
(\url{https://discourse.matplotlib.org}) instance.  While users have
to subscribe or register respectively to post, these forums are open
to all.  We also maintain a read-only mailing list for announcements
(\url{https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/matplotlib-announce}).

Matplotlib developers have frequently attended meetings including
SciPy, PyData, and science conferences.

\section{Open Science and Data Management Plan}
\setcounter{page}{1}

Matplotlib is a software library and does not produce any scientific
data as defined in E.1.2 that needs to be preserved.  Matplotlib is a
tool used to visualize data that is acquired through other means.

Matplotlib is a community library developed in the open on GitHub.
It is released the Matplotlib license
(\url{https://matplotlib.org/users/license.html}) is a permissive
license that is a derivative of the PSF license
(\url{https://docs.python.org/3/license.html}) and compatible with the
BSD-3 license.  All work done on Matplotlib as part of this grant will
be done through the current workflow, will be publicly available, and
released under the same license.  Matplotlib uses git for version
control, thus every developer has the full history on their computer
which provides significant redundancy.  Tagged releases of the
software are published to PyPI (in both source and binary forms).  In
addition, Anaconada, macports, homebrew, and all major Linux
distributions independently build, package, and distribute Matplotlib.
Extensive User facing documentation, including install instructions
and usage guides, is built and hosted at \url{https://matplotlib.org}.

Any new libraries created as part of the ROSES award will be developed
in the open on GitHub and will released under a permissive license.

Any incidental work on other software packages, either upstream or
downstream of Matplotlib, will follow the license and development of
process of those projects.

\section{Inclusion Plan}
\setcounter{page}{1}
% 2 pages

% Inclusion is a core NASA value, as described in the NASA Administrator’s policy
% statement on Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA). Additionally, Strategy
% 4.1 of the latest version of “Science 2020-2024: A Vision for Scientific Excellence”
% states: “Increase the diversity of thought and backgrounds represented across the entire
% SMD portfolio through a more inclusive environment.”
% Inclusion is defined here as the full participation, belonging, and contribution of
% organizations and individuals. Note that inclusion is distinct and different from diversity.
% Inclusion requires that all individuals can participate fully, regardless of the diversity
% dimension, do their best work, advance their career, and feel welcomed, valued,
% connected, engaged, and supported to reach their full potential. If a program element
% requires an Inclusion Plan, it shall focus on inclusion, not diversity, accessibility, or
% equity.
% Proposers shall tailor their Inclusion Plans specifically to the proposal team rather than
% to generic issues in the broader STEM community surrounding inclusion. If
% volunteers/citizen scientists are among the proposed investigators, see Section 1(i), the
% inclusion plan should apply to those team members as well. Inclusion plans should be
% distinct from, and not solely focus on, public engagement efforts.
% Proposers are encouraged to leverage institutional resources when available. However,
% the plan should not include a restatement of policies of the host institution; rather, it
% shall provide a clear discussion of how these policies connect to the proposed
% investigation and proposal team.
% The Inclusion Plan shall:
% • clearly state the goals for creating and sustaining a positive and inclusive working
% environment for the investigation team and describe activities to achieve such an
% environment;
% • identify barriers to creating a positive and inclusive working environment that are
% specific to the team carrying out the proposed investigation;
% • address ways in which the investigation team will work to attenuate or reduce
% these barriers;
% • describe roles, responsibilities, and work efforts for Inclusion Plan activities for
% team members with specific tasks in said activities;
% • include a timeline for completing or carrying out proposed activities;
% • and contain a plan for evaluating progress towards achieving the proposed
% Inclusion Plan activities or goals.
% Unless prohibited by the program element, teams may request funding for the hiring of
% experts and/or those familiar with inclusion best practices to join the team, advise on, or
% oversee the proposed Inclusion Plan efforts. Any funding requested for Inclusion Planrelated activities shall be explicitly identified and justified in the Inclusion Plan section
% and clearly identified in the proposal budget.
% See individual program elements for the required location in the proposal for Inclusion
% Plans and page limits. For programs that use dual anonymous peer review, the
% inclusion plans are generally to be anonymized, but please refer to the specific
% instructions for the program element. If institutions or partners are contributing to or
% assisting with the Inclusion Plan efforts, but they are not otherwise on the proposal
% team, then Letters of Resource Support (see Table 1) must be included after the
% Inclusion Plan references, unless otherwise specified in the program element, and do
% not count toward the page limit noted in the program element.
% The assessment of the Inclusion Plan will be based on these factors:
% ● The extent to which the Inclusion Plan provided appropriate processes and goals
% for both creating and sustaining a positive and inclusive working environment for
% the investigation team;
% ● The extent to which the Inclusion Plan demonstrated awareness of systemic
% barriers to creating inclusive working environments that are or may be specific to
% the proposal team;
% ● The extent to which the Inclusion Plan contained appropriate activities for
% equipping team members to build and maintain inclusive working environments;
% ● The extent to which the roles and responsibilities for those participating in the
% proposed activities were well described and justified;
% ROSES SoS-37
% ● The reasonableness of the proposed timeline for the proposed Inclusion Plan
% activities;
% ● The extent to which the Inclusion Plan provided reasonable and appropriate
% assessment mechanisms for measuring progress in and success of the proposed
% activities;
% ● The reasonableness of the resources requested to execute the proposed
% activities and the quality and appropriateness of the justification for these
% resources.
% The assessment of the Inclusion Plan will be led by individuals with practical and/or
% research expertise in IDEA topics.
% Feedback will be provided to proposers in a separate Inclusion Plan evaluation form.
% The assessment of the Inclusion Plan will not be part of the adjectival rating for the
% proposal and will not inform the selection of proposals.
% It is the proposal team’s responsibility to carry out the proposed activities rather than
% fully outsource them. All team members are expected to contribute to fostering an
% inclusive and positive work environment, regardless of their involvement with specific
% Inclusion Plan activities.
% The Inclusion Plan and any associated activities are expected to reflect the size of
% proposal team, scale and complexity of the proposed research project, and the available
% budget.
% Some resources and research that may be useful when formulating an Inclusion Plan,
% can be found at https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/inclusion.
% Progress in executing the investigation’s Inclusion Plan shall be described in the annual
% progress report.

\section{Budget Justification}
\setcounter{page}{1}
\subsection{Budget Narrative}

Due to being an established community driven project most regular
contributors have established and distinct primary institutions.  For
this reason significant portions of the budget will need to be
subcontracted to the primary institutions of key individuals who are
uniquely qualified for this work.

Salary support is requested for PI Dr.\ Thomas A.\ Caswell (0.25 FTE in
years 1-3).  He will participate in all aspects of the proposed work
and supervise the RSE.

Salary support is requested for a Research Software Engineer (1 FTE in
years 1-3).  The RSE will be responsible for carrying out the data
model refactoring and general maintenance tasks on Matplotlib.  The
RSE will be hired as a consultant through NumFOCUS.

Support is requested for the RSE to attend the SciPy conference in
Austin, TX each year.  Cost estimates are based on the following: Meal
per diem from the GSA website, airfare from NYC to ATX from
\url{https://travel.google.com}, 2019 registration and conference hotel.

\begin{tabular}{|r|r|}
  \hline
  & Austin, TX scipy conference\\\hline
  airfare & \$500 \\\hline
  lodging & \$770 (5 nights at \$154/night) \\\hline
  Registration & \$700 \\\hline
  per diem & \$396 (\$61/day) \\\hline
  misc ground transport & \$100 \\\hline\hline
  total for one person & \$2,466    \\\hline
\end{tabular}


NumFOCUS organizes 4-5 regional PyData conferences in the United
States each year.  Support is requested for the RSE to attend one of
the PyData conference each year.  Cost estimates are based on the
following: Meal and hotel per diem from the GSA website for NYC in
November (as a worst-case scenario), airfare from NYC to LAX from
\url{https://travel.google.com}, and guidance from NumFOCUS as to the
registration fee.


\begin{tabular}{|r|r|}
  \hline
  & New York, NY  PyDATA conference\\\hline
  airfare & \$500     \\\hline
  lodging & \$858 (3 nights at \$286/night)     \\\hline
  Registration & \$200     \\\hline
  per diem & \$342 (\$76/day)     \\\hline
  misc ground transport & \$100     \\\hline\hline
  total for one person & \$2,000     \\\hline
\end{tabular}

Total requested for travel: \$13,398

\subsubsection{Facilities and Equipment}

Standard desktop workstations that Caswell has access to, either
through BNL or personal hardware, is sufficient for this work.

We request \$4,000 to purchase a computer, monitor, and accessories
for the RSE.
